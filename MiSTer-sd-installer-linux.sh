# MiSTer installation script for Linux by rwk.                                     #
# based on Michael Smith (shmitty) <root@retrospace.be> macOS script               #
#                                                                                  #
# Thanks to rattboi who posted Naomi Peori's MiSTer SD Card Info file on the       #
# SmokeMonster Elite fpga-general discord channel and everyone involved and in and #
# using the MiSTer project.                                                        #
#                                                                                  #
# IMPORTANT: Use this script at your own risk. It WILL WIPE ALL DATA on the device #
# you specify. On standard Linux this is usually /dev/mmcblkX or /dev/sdX but make #
# sure to double check.                                                            #

# Prerequisites:                                                                   #

# * wget                                                                           #
# * unrar                                                                          #

# (install using your packet manager: e.g., apt-get install git wget unrar).       #
